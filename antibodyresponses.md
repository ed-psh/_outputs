There is good agreement between the neutralising antibody (nAb) responses measured in eluted DBS and paired sera. This emerged from this study by ISARIC4C, supporting the use of filter paper as a viable sample collection method to study n(Ab) responses. 
The management of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 is evolving following the introduction vaccines. Hence, ISARIC4C identified the importance of measuring nAb to monitor vaccine efficacy. Considering the large-scale sero-surveillance, ISARIC4C resorted to use of fingerstick dried blood spots for the sample collection; as these are inexpensive and easy to manage i.e. transportation and storage. The team also measured nAb responses in sera, venous blood and fingerstick blood stored on filter paper at room temperature.
