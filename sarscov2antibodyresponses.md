ISARIC4C have, in this study shown discernible differences in the humoral immune responses between males and females. These differences associate with age as well as with resultant disease severity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic enables the analysis of immune responses induced against a novel coronavirus infecting immunologically na√Øve individuals. This provided an opportunity for analysis of immune responses and associations with age, sex and disease severity. 
The investigators measured an array of solid-phase binding antibody and viral neutralising Ab (nAb) responses in participants (n=337) of the ISARIC4C cohort and characterised their correlation with peak disease severity during acute infection and early convalescence.
Overall, the responses in a Double Antigen Binding Assay (DABA) for antibody to the receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) correlated well with IgM as well as IgG responses against viral spike, S1 and nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigens. DABA reactivity also correlated with nAb.
