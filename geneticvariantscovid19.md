ISARIC4C researchers and the GenOMICC team have previously shown that genetics can help us to choose which drugs might be effective in treating critically ill patients, when they discovered a genetic clue that pointed to a specific treatment for Covid-19: a drug called baricitinib. This was the first proof-of-concept in critical illness and infectious disease for finding an effective drug using human genetics.
A total of 49 genetic variants associated with critical illness in COVID-19 were identified. To explore whether these variants can identify new drugs, these teams investigated the link between protein-coding variants, gene and protein expression. They found druggable targets in multiple systems in the immune response, including inflammatory signalling (JAK1), monocyte-macrophage activation and endothelial permeability (PDE4A), and immunometabolism (SLC2A5, AK5). It was found that these protein-coding variants have the potential for therapeutic use with existing compounds able to inhibit or induce a response to inflammatory stimulation.
